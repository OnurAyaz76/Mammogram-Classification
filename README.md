 Mammogram-Classification project is to predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant. First part is as usual preprocessing such as naming columns, deleting rows with missing values and standardizing variables. Then different machine learning techniques are used like Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic, Regression, Neural Network using Keras. Except Decision Trees every other algorithm produced similar %79-80 accuracy. Additional hyperparameter tuning, or different topologies of the multi-level perceptron might make a difference.
