 Mammogram-Classification project is to predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant. First part is as usual preprocessing such as naming columns, deleting rows with missing values and standardizing variables. Then different machine learning techniques are used like Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks using Keras. Except Decision Trees every other algorithm produced %79-80 accuracy. Additional hyperparameter tuning, or different topologies of the multi-level perceptron might make a difference.
